🌊 Smart Community Health Monitoring & Early Warning System

AI-powered, IoT-enabled, community-driven platform to prevent water-borne disease outbreaks in rural Northeast India.

📖 Project Overview

Water-borne diseases like cholera, diarrhea, and hepatitis A are a major health challenge in rural and flood-prone areas of Northeast India. Outbreaks often occur due to contaminated water sources, delayed reporting, and lack of early warning systems.

This project provides a Smart Health Surveillance & Early Warning Platform that integrates:

📱 Mobile App (Offline & Multilingual) → for villagers, ASHA workers, and volunteers to report symptoms & water quality.

📡 IoT Sensors → real-time water quality monitoring (pH, turbidity, bacterial presence).

🤖 AI/ML Prediction Engine → forecasts disease outbreaks based on health + environmental data.

🔔 Alert System → real-time notifications to villagers & health officials in local tribal languages.

📊 Dashboard for Authorities → visualize hotspots, track interventions, and allocate resources efficiently.

🚀 Key Features

✅ Community Health Reporting – Symptom reporting in local languages (text, icons, voice).
✅ Offline Support – Works without internet; syncs when connectivity returns.
✅ IoT Water Monitoring – Sensors/test kits detect unsafe water sources.
✅ AI/ML Forecasting – Predicts outbreaks using symptoms + water + weather data.
✅ Multilingual Alerts – SMS/app alerts in local dialects for awareness & prevention.
✅ Admin Dashboard – Health departments can monitor hotspots in real-time.

IoT sensors stream water quality data.

Data Processing

Backend API stores & validates data.

AI engine analyzes patterns (symptoms + water + environment).

Prediction & Alerts

AI forecasts possible outbreaks.

Alerts sent to communities (app notifications, SMS, WhatsApp).

Visualization

Health officials access dashboard with maps, charts, and reports.

🎯 Uniqueness

Offline-first app for rural, low-connectivity areas.

Multilingual UI & voice support for tribal/illiterate populations.

Hybrid data collection → IoT + manual reporting ensures resilience.

AI-powered prediction → proactive, not reactive.

Community + Government collaboration for long-term sustainability.
